server.vimrc
============

Single-file, minimalistic config for Vim (not nvim!) I use on my servers.

The only purpose this repo exists is that I want to install my config as easy as:

curl -SsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikonov1101/server.vimrc/refs/heads/main/vimrc > /root/.vimrc

Keybindings is a subset of my neovim[1] bindings, rewritten in vimscipt.

The "onedark" color scheme[2] is in use for ages, and I like it much more than the default one,
so I just glued it up at the end of the file.
